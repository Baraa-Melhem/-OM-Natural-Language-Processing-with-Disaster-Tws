This is my code that I used to submit a late submission on "-OM-Natural-Language-Processing-with-Disaster-Tws" competetion on KAGGLE 
and I got score of : 0.76555

Competition Description
Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).

But, it’s not always clear whether a person’s words are actually announcing a disaster.
